# Applied-Math
Group projects from Applied Math courses:

- Conformal Mapping: My team and I researched an extension of our course material, namely the Conformal Mapping technique, and applied what we learned to solve for the motion of ideal fluid flowing through different geometrical spaces. 

- Soliton Analysis: I needed to find the speed of a bulge of liquid in a liquid conduit experiment which behaved like a soliton. To do this I needed to back out the slope of a specific line, the leading edge, within contour plots depicting several experimental data matrices. 

- Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA): My team and I researched an extension of our course material, the SSA method, which is used to distinguish between signal and noise in real world data. We applied the method to weather data to extract long term and seasonal trends. We also applied the method to housing market data.
